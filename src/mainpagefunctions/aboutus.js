            <h3>About us</h3>
            <body>We are VR1Family Charity Aid Services, a global organization committed to providing immediate humanitarian assistance and improving the lives of people in need. 

                VR1Family was founded in June 2019 by a group of 5 volunteers in a garage in Mallacoota, Australia, who were united in the belief that every person deserves a chance to thrive irrespective of personal circumstances. Their first project to collect aid and donations from community members and distribute it to people that were affected during the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires.
                
                Following appreciation from local news channels as well as the international media, the group was able to rapidly expand its operations, starting a journey to create a better world for all.
                
                Since our inception, we have grown to become a global organization with our presence established in over 100 countries and served by a dedicated team of 15,000 volunteers. We have served communities in many countries during natural disasters such as the Mount Sumeru volcanic eruption in Indonesia, flooding in Belgium and Germany, and the earthquake in Haiti.
                
                At VR1Family Charity Aid Services, we distribute survival kits in the event of a natural disaster, including food, water, and clothing. We have also expanded our operations to provide various other humanitarian assistance packages, such as wool and baby food, soap/textiles and toy packages, plow and farm tool packages, medical supply packages, and resettlement kits for refugees.
                
                We are committed to helping those in need, and this is why we run regular fund-raising events. We believe that our work is only possible because of the generosity of our supporters and volunteers.
                
                We are proud of what we have achieved so far, but there is still much more work to be done. At VR1Family Charity Aid Services, we remain dedicated to creating a better world for all, one person at a time. Join us today and help make a difference.
